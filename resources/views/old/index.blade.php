				<img src="images/Self3.jpg">
				Hello! I graduated yesterday (July 8) from Stony Brook University with a bachelor of science in computer science. I grew up in New York City. As a kid, I've always liked to learn about how things work. The software field has inspired me to continuously learn about new technologies and the different things that can be done with those technologies. College has allowed me to enjoy various aspects of the computer science field and has taught me many ways to use this acquired knowledge to my advantage. As my college career ends, I would like to find an internship or a full time job related to the technology field. My ideal career is to be part of a team that is productive, intelligent, and innovative. I want to experience the real world and see what challenges would come to me so I can overcome them.

				I want to get better in basketball. #MambaMentality

	<!-- 			<h3>Penspinning (retired)</h3>
					Below is a n-year old video of my penspinning skills. I used to be really bad at it, but I dedicated a lot of time to 
					learn and practice these tricks until I can do them smoothly and consistently. This shows that with hard work 
					and dedication pays off.<br>
